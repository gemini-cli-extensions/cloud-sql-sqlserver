# Cloud SQL for SQL Server Agent Skills

> [!NOTE]
> This extension is currently in beta (pre-v1.0), and may see breaking changes until the first stable release (v1.0).

This repository provides a set of agent skills to interact with [Cloud SQL for SQL Server](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/sqlserver) instances. These skills can be used with various AI agents, including [Gemini CLI](https://google-gemini.github.io/gemini-cli/), Claude Code, and Codex, to manage your databases, execute queries, explore schemas, and troubleshoot issues using natural language prompts.

## Why Use Cloud SQL for SQL Server Agent Skills?

- **Seamless Workflow:** Integrates seamlessly into your AI agent's environment. No need to constantly switch contexts for common database tasks.
- **Natural Language Queries:** Stop wrestling with complex commands. Explore schemas and query data by describing what you want in plain English.
- **Full Lifecycle Control:** Manage the entire lifecycle of your database, from creating instances to exploring schemas and running queries.
- **Code Generation:** Accelerate development by asking your agent to generate data classes and other code snippets based on your table schemas.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- One of these AI agents installed
  - [Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli) version **v0.6.0** or higher
  - [Claude Code](https://claude.com/product/claude-code) version **v2.1.94** or higher
  - [Codex](https://developers.openai.com/codex) **v0.117.0** or higher
  - [Antigravity](https://antigravity.google) **v1.14.2** or higher
- A Google Cloud project with the **Cloud SQL Admin API** enabled.
- Ensure [Application Default Credentials](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/gcloud) are available in your environment.
- IAM Permissions:
  - Cloud SQL Client (`roles/cloudsql.client`)
  - Cloud SQL Viewer (`roles/cloudsql.viewer`)
  - Cloud SQL Admin (`roles/cloudsql.admin`)

## Getting Started

### Configuration

Please keep these env vars handy during the installation process:

- `CLOUD_SQL_MSSQL_PROJECT`: The GCP project ID.
- `CLOUD_SQL_MSSQL_REGION`: The region of your Cloud SQL instance.
- `CLOUD_SQL_MSSQL_INSTANCE`: The ID of your Cloud SQL instance.
- `CLOUD_SQL_MSSQL_DATABASE`: The name of the database to connect to.
- `CLOUD_SQL_MSSQL_USER`: The database username.
- `CLOUD_SQL_MSSQL_PASSWORD`: The password for the database user.
- `CLOUD_SQL_MSSQL_IP_TYPE`: (Optional) Type of the IP address: `PUBLIC`, `PRIVATE`, or `PSC`. Defaults to `PUBLIC`.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - Ensure [Application Default Credentials](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/gcloud) are available in your environment.
> - If your Cloud SQL for SQL Server instance uses private IPs, you must run your agent in the same Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) network.
> - This configuration is primarily for the Data Plane skills (querying). The Admin toolset does not strictly require these to be pre-set if you provide them in your prompts, but it is recommended for a smoother experience.

### Installation & Usage

To start interacting with your database, install the skills for your preferred AI agent, then launch the agent and use natural language to ask questions or perform tasks.

For the latest version, check the [releases page][releases].

[releases]: https://github.com/gemini-cli-extensions/cloud-sql-sqlserver/releases

## Additional Agent Skills

Find additional skills to support your entire software development lifecycle at [github.com/gemini-cli-extensions](https://github.com/gemini-cli-extensions), including:
* [Generic SQL Server skills](https://github.com/gemini-cli-extensions/sql-server)
* [Cloud SQL for SQL Server Observability extension](https://github.com/gemini-cli-extensions/cloud-sql-sqlserver-observability)
* and more!

## Troubleshooting

Use the debug mode of your agent (e.g., `gemini --debug`) to enable debugging.

Common issues:

* "failed to find default credentials: google: could not find default credentials.": Ensure [Application Default Credentials](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/gcloud) are available in your environment. See [Set up Application Default Credentials](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/external/set-up-adc) for more information.
* "✖ Error during discovery for server: MCP error -32000: Connection closed": The database connection has not been established. Ensure your configuration is set via environment variables.
* "✖ MCP ERROR: Error: spawn .../toolbox ENOENT": The Toolbox binary did not download correctly. Ensure you are using the latest version of your agent.
* "cannot execute binary file": The Toolbox binary did not download correctly. Ensure the correct binary for your OS/Architecture has been downloaded. See [Installing the server](https://mcp-toolbox.dev/documentation/introduction/#install-toolbox) for more information.
