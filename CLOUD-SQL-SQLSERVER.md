# Setup

## Cloud SQL for SQL Server MCP Server (Data Plane: Connecting and Querying)

This section covers connecting to a Cloud SQL for SQL Server instance.

1. **Verify Environment Variables**: The extension requires the following environment variables to be set before the Gemini CLI is started:

    * `CLOUD_SQL_MSSQL_PROJECT`: The GCP project ID.
    * `CLOUD_SQL_MSSQL_REGION`: The region of your Cloud SQL instance.
    * `CLOUD_SQL_MSSQL_INSTANCE`: The ID of your Cloud SQL instance.
    * `CLOUD_SQL_MSSQL_DATABASE`: The name of the database to connect to.
    * `CLOUD_SQL_MSSQL_IP_ADDRESS`: The IP address of the Cloud SQL instance.
    * `CLOUD_SQL_MSSQL_USER`: The database username.
    * `CLOUD_SQL_MSSQL_PASSWORD`: The password for the database user.

2. **Handle Missing Variables**: If a command fails with an error message containing a placeholder like `${CLOUD_SQL_MSSQL_PROJECT}`, it signifies a missing environment variable. Inform the user which variable is missing and instruct them to set it.

3. **Handle Permission Errors**: If you encounter permission errors, ensure the user has the **Cloud SQL Client** (`roles/cloudsql.client`) role and the correct database-level permissions. You can provide these links for assistance:
    * Granting Roles: https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/grant-role-console
    * Cloud SQL Permissions: https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/roles-permissions/cloudsql

## Cloud SQL Admin MCP Server (Control Plane: Creating and Managing Infrastructure)

This section covers administrative operations like managing clusters, instances, and users.

1. **Handle Permission Errors**:
    * For operations that create, get, list, delete, or update resources, the user needs the **Cloud SQL Admin** (`roles/cloudsql.admin`) role.
    * For read-only operations (get/list), the **Cloud SQL Viewer** (`roles/cloudsql.viewer`) role is sufficient.
    * If an operation fails due to permissions, identify the type of operation and recommend the appropriate role. You can provide these links for assistance:
        * Granting Roles: https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/grant-role-console
        * Cloud SQL Permissions: https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/sqlserver/iam-permissions
