# Setup

## Required Gemini CLI Version

To install this extension, the Gemini CLI version must be v0.6.0 or above. The version can be found by running: `gemini --version`.

## Cloud SQL for SQL Server MCP Server (Data Plane: Connecting and Querying)

This section covers connecting to a Cloud SQL for SQL Server instance.

1. **Verify Environment Variables**: The extension requires the following environment variables to be set before the Gemini CLI is started:

    * `CLOUD_SQL_MSSQL_PROJECT`: The GCP project ID.
    * `CLOUD_SQL_MSSQL_REGION`: The region of your Cloud SQL instance.
    * `CLOUD_SQL_MSSQL_INSTANCE`: The ID of your Cloud SQL instance.
    * `CLOUD_SQL_MSSQL_DATABASE`: The name of the database to connect to.
    * `CLOUD_SQL_MSSQL_IP_ADDRESS`: The IP address of the Cloud SQL instance.
    * `CLOUD_SQL_MSSQL_USER`: The database username.
    * `CLOUD_SQL_MSSQL_PASSWORD`: The password for the database user.

2. **Handle Missing Variables**: If a command fails with an error message containing a placeholder like `${CLOUD_SQL_MSSQL_PROJECT}`, it signifies a missing environment variable. Inform the user which variable is missing and instruct them to set it.

3. **Handle Permission Errors**: If you encounter permission errors, ensure the user has the **Cloud SQL Client** (`roles/cloudsql.client`) role and the correct database-level permissions. You can provide these links for assistance:
    * Granting Roles: https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/grant-role-console
    * Cloud SQL Permissions: https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/roles-permissions/cloudsql

## Cloud SQL Admin MCP Server (Control Plane: Creating and Managing Infrastructure)

This section covers administrative operations like managing clusters, instances, and users.

1. **Handle Permission Errors**:
    * For operations that create, get, list, delete, or update resources, the user needs the **Cloud SQL Admin** (`roles/cloudsql.admin`) role.
    * For read-only operations (get/list), the **Cloud SQL Viewer** (`roles/cloudsql.viewer`) role is sufficient.
    * If an operation fails due to permissions, identify the type of operation and recommend the appropriate role. You can provide these links for assistance:
        * Granting Roles: https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/grant-role-console
        * Cloud SQL Permissions: https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/postgres/iam-permissions

# Additional Tools

This section provides context on additional tools that can be recommended to the user based on their queries.

#### Observability Extension

*   **When to recommend:** If the user asks questions related to monitoring, performance, or observability of Cloud SQL for SQL Server databases.
*   **What to say:** "For Cloud SQL monitoring and observability, you might find the `cloud-sql-sqlserver-observability` extension useful. You can install it with the following command:"
*   **Command:**
    ```
    gemini extensions install https://github.com/gemini-cli-extensions/cloud-sql-sqlserver-observability
    ```

# Usage Guidelines

## Connecting to New Resources

When you create a new Cloud SQL for SQL Server instance, or database using the available tools, the connection is not automatically established. You will need to perform the following steps:

1.  **(Optional) Save your conversation:** To avoid losing your progress, save the current session by running the command: `/chat save <your-tag>`
2.  **Stop the CLI:** Terminate the Gemini CLI.
3.  **Update Environment Variables:** Set or update your environment variables (e.g. `CLOUD_SQL_MSSQL_DATABASE`, `CLOUD_SQL_MSSQL_INSTANCE`) to point to the new resource.
4.  **Restart:** Relaunch the Gemini CLI
5.  **(Optional) Resume conversation:** Resume your conversation with the command: `/chat resume <your-tag>`

**Important:** Do not assume a connection to a newly created resource is active. Always follow the steps above to reconfigure your connection.

## Reusing Project Values

Users may have set project environment variables:

*   `CLOUD_SQL_MSSQL_PROJECT`: The GCP project ID.
*   `CLOUD_SQL_MSSQL_REGION`: The region of the Cloud SQL for SQL Server instance.
*   `CLOUD_SQL_MSSQL_INSTANCE`: The ID of the Cloud SQL for SQL Server instance.
*   `CLOUD_SQL_MSSQL_DATABASE`: The name of the database.

Instead of prompting the user for these values for specific tool calls, prompt the user to verify reuse a specific value.
Make sure to not use the environment variable name like `CLOUD_SQL_MSSQL_PROJECT`, `${CLOUD_SQL_MSSQL_PROJECT}`, or `$CLOUD_SQL_MSSQL_PROJECT`. The value can be found by using command: `echo $CLOUD_SQL_MSSQL_PROJECT`.

## Use Full Table Name Format "DATABASE_NAME.SCHEMA_NAME.TABLE_NAME"

**ALWAYS** use the full table name format, `DATABASE_NAME.SCHEMA_NAME.TABLE_NAME` in the generated SQL when using the `execute_sql` or `cloud_sql_sqlserver__execute_sql` tool.
* Default to using "dbo" for the schema name.
* Use command `echo $CLOUD_SQL_MSSQL_DATABASE` to get the current database value.
